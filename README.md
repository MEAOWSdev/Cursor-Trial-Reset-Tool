## Description

The **Cursor Trial Reset Tool** is a Python script that allows you to reset the device IDs in Cursor's configuration file. This is useful for generating a new random device ID, which may be necessary in certain situations, such as resetting Cursor's trial period.

## How It Works

The script does the following:

1. **File Backup:** Creates a timestamped backup of Cursor's configuration file.
2. **File Location:** Determines the location of the configuration file based on the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. **ID Reset:** Generates new random device IDs and saves them to the configuration file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `reset.py` script.
2. Run the script with Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 reset.py
   The script will reset the device IDs and display the newly generated IDs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- File system access to read and write Cursor's configuration file.

## Usage Example

```bash
$ python3 reset.py
